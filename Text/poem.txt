Pascal's Whisper

In Pascal's world, the code is clear,
With structured steps, we hold it dear.
Procedures, types, and constants bright,
A simple way to code it right.

The semicolon guides our path,
Through loops and ifs, no coder's wrath.
A variable's scope, a function's call,
In Pascal's realm, we conquer all.

From Turbo times to Delphi's shore,
Pascal's language is evermore.
A sturdy bridge to guide our way,
In structured code, we'll always stay.
